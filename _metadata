  "description" : "[b]Display the names of the npcs and monsters you interact/attack(Like in Castlevania games).[/b]\nThis mod is client sided(i will explain in more detail below). It can be installed mid-game and can be safely unnistalled.\n\nIt should be compatible with anything. Mods that add new NPCs and Monster can add built-in support by their authors or other users can make patches for them to display their names and title correctly. \n\nClient side note: While is not neccessary for all the clients to have this mod installed, if the server doesn't have this mod installed but the client does, the mod will not work for clients(doesn't crash or causes log errors or lag).\n\n[url=https://github.com/Chofranc/Starbound-Book-Of-Spirits/releases]Non-Steam Version[/url]\n\n[h1]New Modding Guide[/h1]\nI have made a new guide for patching/supporting the mod for modders. You can find [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3122884751]The Guide Here.[/url]\n\n[h3]PM on discord if you have any doubts or need help with adding support: chofranc[/h3]\n\nNEW BIG UPDATE 3.0\nYou can now rename ship pets!\nInteract twice with your ship pet within the span of 0.5 seconds to open the rename interface.\n\nCustom pets from mods need to be patched to be able to rename them.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=3471003713]Patch Project[/url], this new mod adds compatibility for mods that aren't fully compatible.\n\nNEW BIG UPDATE 2.0\n\nThis update adds some stuff that i had pending from the release.\n[list]\n    [*]Generated Monster now have names and custom title which is based on their type and parts patterns. The current list only uses the head for the name since i think that is enough, but more part patterns can be added to affect the name.\n    [*]Rare variants of monsters now have custom title to identify them easier.\n    [*]Added custom title for elite monsters.\n    [*]Added a Steam Guide to make it easier to understand how to patch/support the mod for modders.\n[/list] \n\n[h1]Troubleshooting:[/h1]\n\nThe menu icon appears over my head when hitting an enemy!\nA: There is probably another mod that is adding back the menu icon for a random reason. You can download the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1421523226]What Menu?[/url] mod to remove it completely.\n\n[h1]Credits[/h1]\nThanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverSokolova/myworkshopfiles/?appid=211820][b]Silver Sokolova[/b][/url] for the help of mod detection script(\"bookofspirits_interact_support.lua\").\nThanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3101485145][b]Poine[/b][/url] for helping me with the dynamic custom titles for generated monsters.",
